•	Comparative study of Machine Learning models for Sepsis Prediction:
-> In this study, four different models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naïve Bayes) were applied to predict a life-threatening infection “Sepsis”. 
-> The dataset used in this project is from Physio-Net 2019 Challenge.
-> In the analysis it was found that Decision Tree (96.8557%) and KNN (92.5891%) with their respective accuracies were two of the best models that can be used for Sepsis Prediction.
